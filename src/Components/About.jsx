            My name is Emmanuel Massey. I am an Associate Software Engineer
            looking to use my coding skills and problem-solving skills to help
            develop solutions to solve the most complex problems for
            users/clients. I enjoy seeking new opportunities to learn more and
            share my knowledge with others through collaboration and mentorship.
            In my free time I enjoy playing soccer, traveling, and enjoying
            family and nature.
